# Python-Password-GEN-
Password generator written in Python (open source)

This code generates a random password using a combination of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. The user is prompted to input the number of passwords they want to generate. The code then uses the random library to randomly select characters from a predefined set of characters and join them together to form a password. The passwords are then printed out to the console. After the password generation process is complete, the user is prompted to input whether they want to generate more passwords or not. If the user inputs "yes", the password generation process is repeated. If the user inputs anything else, the script exits.
